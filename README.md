This repository serves as an automated monitor for the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)'s [Save Page Now](https://web.archive.org/save) system. It logs internal queue metrics and system status every 5 minutes to a [CSV dataset](db.csv).

The project is useful for analyzing the load, fidelity, and performance trends of the Wayback Machine's archival infrastructure over time.
